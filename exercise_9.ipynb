Because you are cloning a Github repository that only we can push to, you should **NEVER EDIT** any of the files you pull from Github. Instead, what you should do, is either make a new notebook and write your solutions in there, or **make a copy of this notebook and save it somewhere else** on your computer, not inside the `sds` folder that you cloned, so you can write your answers in there. If you edit the notebook you pulled from Github, those edits (possible your solutions to the exercises) may be overwritten and lost the next time you pull from Github.

      "After five years it was time for me to replace the carbon media in my PC-600.  I called Customer Service for assistance.  They were friendly and informative, however, that did not prevent me from having an unfavorable experience.  First, it costs over $200 for the carbon replacement kit, which is basically a sack of coconut shell carbon plus about $10 worth of plastic parts.  The replacement job is tricky, but it is expected to be a DIY.  I did try calling two of the plumbers on the recommended list supplied by Pelican, including the company that installed the system, but neither returned my call.  Pelican did supply a YouTube link which clearly explains the procedure, so I endeavored to do the job myself.  Every step of the way I watched the video, and reviewed the written instructions and it went flawlessly up to the point where I emptied and discarded the old media, poured in new media, and left it soaking for 48 hours.  The covering for my tube was made of plastic and it disintegrated when I removed it.  I reported this to Customer Service and they informed me that Pelican discontinued using plastic, my five year old system did not guarantee replacement, and I would have to purchase as stainless steel cover from them for $143.  So the 48-hour soaking period was extended several days while I waited for the new tube covering.  When the covering came, it did not fit over my tube.  Customer Service was pleasant and agreed to send me a new tube for no extra cost.  I had to wait another week for it to arrive.  Then I had to empty the soaked media from the old tube, remove the down tube and place it in the new tank, and carefully pour in the soaked media into the new tank.  Now I am in the 72-hour period of not using high flow appliances, such as laundry and dish washer, and my water will be charcoal tinted for about 10 days.  This part is normal for everybody.  You replace the old carbon and soak the new for 48 hours.  For the next 72 hours, you have to bypass the system when you use laundry of dishwasher.  For me it took much longer.  I have spent $350 and engaged in a month long process, just to complete the media replacement that needs to be done every five years.\n",

      "Install date 6/1/18 scheduled between 8-10 AM. Didn’t show up until 11:30AM.\n",
      "The install crew did not leave until 9:30 PM. It was dark when I was requested to look at the completed job.  They were delayed waiting on another crew to come to the jobsite to explain the process of installing the system. They reset a gutter on the back of my house and now it has an excessive slope, and reinstalled the downspout with the clamps in a different location leaving several holes visible in the down spout. There are also visible holes in my Fascia caused by moving the gutter There are excessive gaps between the sections, and there are areas where the back portion of the Leaffilter is causing my shingles to bow up. I contacted LeafFilter the next day (6/2/18) via their website to address my concerns. I got no reply, so on 6/6/18 I called the company, and was told the inspection would happen on June 12. The inspector came on June 12th and told me there were multiple issues with the install, and I would be contacted to get the issues corrected, he told me it may require a complete reinstall. It is now 6/15/18, and I have not been contacted. I called the service number and was told there was no record of issues with my system, and they would call the local office to see what is going on. Waiting on a call back.\n",

      "My experience was amazing with CardKangaroo. The process was easy, and after paying, I got a phone call confirmation within minutes, and my gift card about 5 minutes after. Overall, from payment to receiving the card, everything was super smooth and quick. In total, the card took about 15 minutes after payment to arrive. I had tried Cardpool right before I tried this site, and not only did they take 24 hours to \"process\" everything, they sent me an email saying their risk assesment team wouldn't process my payment, so that was a huge waste of time.

Also I don't like most of the offers I get in my inbox because you go through and do what they say but don't get rewarded for them. Seems like jumping through hoops. also the discover offers, some of them are the same way. Overall, this is a legit and easy way to make money on the side.\n",

      "I am a committed bike commuter. Preparing to buy a house in north Seattle, but working on capitol hill, I have hills both ways, about a 7 mile commute, and have spent too many mornings and evenings mopping sweat as I arrive to work and back home, particularly on warmer days (>50 degrees does it for me!).  I am cruising up the hills with guilt-inducing speed, MUCH cooler, and still get a good workout. Cycling on the flats at my usual cruising speed ~20 mph is beyond the e-assist speed, but this feels fine. My road bike is notably heavier and handles a little differently with the additional weight in the front, but it's small and I will learn quickly. I have been a little surprised to find that there is a barely perceptible drag when I am cruising... it's not the additional weight. It MIGHT be the transition from e-assist to my own power. I worry that it is something electrical intrinsic to an electric motor. If I didn't have the big hills, and were out for a mostly flat cruise, I would be tempted to switch out to my old front wheel. If I had my kiddos in the bike trailer, I would definitely stick with the Hill-topper wheel (AKA wind-stopper AKA tot-hauler). I got great service from the staff and enjoyed talking to them when I picked up my wheel at their warehouse space in SODO.\n",

      "I was initially somewhat skeptical about this whole \"salt-less\" concept. I previously owned a salt softener system, and hauled countless bags of salt home to insure the system performed properly. I read all of the information provided on the Pelican website, and eventually convinced myself to give it a try. I ordered my NS3 system on the Pelican website, along with the installation package and the pre filter replacement package. All of the components arrived a week later and after a quick examination and inventory of what I had purchased, I assessed what was going to be required to make the changeover from my old salt system to my new salt-less system. After removal of the old system, which included an electrical cord to run the old timer, as well as the discharge line that ran to the sewer for the regeneration process, I was ready to hook up the new system. A quick layout design and a trip to my local ACE hardware store, I had purchased the necessary 1\" PVC fittings to get everything connected. 30 minutes later, I was filling the system for the first time. Installation was very easy, I am a do it yourself, kind of person, but for those less experianced, it's a simple install for any plumbing company to perform for you. So far it has delivered everything that the company stated and that I expected. I have softened water and I don't have to set a timer for the system to regenerate in the wee hours of the morning, I don't have to feed it and endless supply of salt pellets, I don't have to make any calculations regarding the hardness of my water and the proper concentration of brine. It really is Care Free.\n",

They even took that a step further by ordering (at their cost) 2 extra pieces of the special glass stock.  The reason I know this is that I had to order, as it turns out, 2 extra pieces 1 week prior to my grand opening and they delivered on time.

We decided to go for it and we were pleasantly surprised at the ease of use!  We picked up our passes upon arriving in the city and hit the ground running!  THANK YOU for making our visit to New York AMAZING!  I have and will continue to recommend the New York Pass to all of my friends and family!\n",
      "The Part came quickly, good price, part of the part was on backwards( the clip and the section attached to it) moved the clip,, but not sure  how long it will last due to the groove is on wrong side. maybe that's why parts so cheap compaired to other sites, faulty parts?\n",
      "The wrong item was shipped but it was taken care of immediately upon one simple phone call.\n",
      "I wanted to ask for details so I called Customer Service. They were so friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful, it felt as if I were shopping at a local fish market. I've been a long-time customer and for good reason. I know how hard it is to get really fresh seafood. With Vial Choice, I've never discovered a fishy odor or watery fish packed on a filthy towel wrapped in plastic wrap. This is a healthy, delicious option, well worth the cost.\n",
      "Ordering was easy. I am excited to try something new. Hope it goes well. Seemed pretty cut and dry.\n",
      "I ordered 6 pairs.  Out of the six, 4 are holding up well after two uses and a hand wash.  One of them, of another pair, falls halfway down my calf after a couple hours.  The last pair doesn’t stay up, not even from the beginning.  It’s worthless.  The socks that don’t slip down are great!  Love them.  Can’t use the other two, thus the three stars.  My only other critique is that they are hard to put on over your feet.  Once you are past there, they go on easily.\n",

      "Update:  The company replaced the two defective pairs!  Awesome customer service!  Not expected but appreciated!  Thank you very much! ❤️\n",

      "Fully disappointed by the experience we have endured with this company. We were sent a sick cleaner 2 months ago who gave its virus to our 6 months old baby. We contacted the company to ask for a refund as they promise and offer on their website if the customer isn't satisfied with the service. After sending various emails, we had requested them to cancel our account. This has happened in October and we still have not seen the money back neither they had cancelled our account. Thinking that we had no more ties to this company, suddenly they withdrew an other £20 from our account for a cleaner we have never seen. They had sent an email to let us know that someone would come to clean the place the following day. Did we not ask them to cancel? We refused the cleaner and yet got charged for a service we never received. One, they took the freedom to not cancel our account and secondly, from their policy, they could still charge the fee because we had not cancelled within they agreed window. Oofff!!! This is naughty, naughty, isn't it? Anyway, I hope the saga is over after all the extra emails we have sent.  Please, do answer and justify your unlawful behaviour.\n",

I logged in, entered some basic info, and the next day David Trevino called. We had much in common despite the difference in age, and he gave me the numbers. I tried to find a better deal for each of us, but I could not! I called him back, we did the deal and it was exactly as advertised. We are very pleased, and I am very happy that David is my agent!

This site has so many and it helps to read the reviews that other people have written to find out which card I should apply for. I will definitely be using this website in the future. I also like that you can also purchase prepaid debit cards as well as gift cards if you don't want to apply for a credit card. I will also be using that feature as well.\n",
      "The t-shirt I ordered arrived with a pink stain on shoulder and front. They replaced it fast and free and let me keep the stained shirt as well. One point deducted for print quality. It's basically a computer printed transfer, not a silk screen print. $40 something ( including postage) bucks for a t-shirt should get me a nicely printed silk screen shirt.\n",
      "Great service. Up to minute status a big plus.\n",
      "I highly recommend this Town Fair Tire. Went in prepared to pay for a new tire and found out my current tire was fixable. Instead of taking my money, they told me about the less expensive solution. Very honest. I'll be a customer for life and gladly recommend them.\n",

It turned out that they all reneged on their promises.  When my granddaughter told me about Drive Time I was a bit hesitant because of all the let downs.  Drive Time helped me get a 2015 SUV with a low monthly payment!  The service person Justin Morris was very helpful and a professional.  He was very thorough about explaining the process to me.

When we called Priceline back, we were given the run-around trying to get answers on this - one person even hung up on us/cut us off when she couldn't help us with this issue. Now, Priceline is in the process of looking into possibly refunding the approximate value ($10/person) of a breakfast. We'll see how that goes. Next time, I would not use Priceline, as it has been a hassle just dealing with this one issue. I'd hate to see if there was anything issue more complex.\n",

I ordered 4 different shirts and loved them all.  The quality of the cotton and the shirt construction was great.  Redbubble had put their own special touch on the delivered product and that was pretty cool! (Shhh!  don't want to ruin it for future customers). Great marketing!

      "Jack was a pleasure to work with.  However, I've not been as pleased with the product for the most part.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The reason I have not been completely satisfied with the product is a few things:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The set up directions I received with the product stated I was supposed to receive 4 support poles.  I only received 3.  When I inquired about this with Jack, he stated I must have received an older model's set up directions and that the new models only have 3 support poles.  Jack assured me that there would still be enough support - however the balance of support seemed off to me, so I ended up purchasing another support pole for an additional $300 on top of the $8,550 I already spent for the display.  Additionally with the support poles, the latch lever does not close AT ALL on any of the latches.  The set-up directions state that the lever may not close all the way - however I find it odd that NONE of them close or latch at all.       \r\n",
      "Additionally, when the 4th pole was delivered, I set up the display and found the side frames to be all scratched up.  My boss even asked if we had purchased a used unit.  They looked THAT bad.  I also was missing an 8ft jumper wire which made the LED lights blink in one portion of the display.  When I brought all of this up to Jack, he was extremely helpful and sent us out new framing that came in MUCH better packaging than what was shipped previously.  He also sent me the 8ft jumper wire that was missing.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without Jack, this experience would have been completely different.  He kept me calm and made me feel comfortable as though he could fix anything that was wrong.  He is a wonderful asset to the DisplayIt team.  \r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I will say, however, that for the money spent on this display - I expected to receive all of the items necessary for this display with the first shipment and also not have them be so scratched up.\n",
      "Superfast shipping, cheap shipping fee. Glad I found this website for used books, much cheaper than Amazon, and just as good.\n",
      "Good quality, original, good service\n",
      "Jessica was great and went above and beyond what I have ever expected when calling about moving any type of residential services. My new home is in a rural area and only days before closing did I learn that ATT was NOT in fact the internet provider listed on the sellers disclosure. I often work from home and connect through a VPN  and use a VOIP for calls,  thus I rely heavily upon a strong and reliable internet connection. She was able to secure a provider with no obligation in the event the service did not meet my needs. I am very grateful for the extra mile and what she did for me. Highly recommend this company.\n",

Later when i try to reach them through live chat, they barely responded, even seemed very rude from the person that responded. So basically nobody gave any information about the shipping status until i received the shipping confirmation, which was already to late. Disappointing experience.\n",

      "The cost of the travel was great but the service provided was very inadequate. It took us a long time before receiving our itenary after booking. The agent we spoke to provided us with the wrong information about our travel and we were honestly not happy with the choice of flight. \n",

      "Ordering process and shipping was great.  Unfortunately one of the products I ordered lasted only two days.  I ordered six 8.5x11 clear display holders with magnetic backs - within the first 24 hours of assembling and mounting them one fell down on its own and broke, and within the next day three more had fallen and cracked. The magnetic strips were put on the holders, pressed evenly and firmly, and allowed to sit for one hour before putting them on the metal surfaces. Each time one fell it was because the holder had separated from the magnet.  The adhesive between the magnet and holder needs a big upgrade.\n",

Probably was but how the \"agreement\" explained was not the same as the agreement on paper. \"SHARP\" practice.\n",

So my sister told me to get my nephew an XBOX Live Gold card on Groupon, I did. How can they mess up an Xbox Live card, right.  Well they sell ones from Brazil that will not work in the US.

What makes it even worse is they are continuing to sell these.\n",

      "Take care of this company! Wizz Air has evidently as business concept to charge exorbitant fees. I passed together with 30 other passengers in their luggage trap which consists of special luggage rules. All of the companies I have flown with allows a cabin suitcase 55x40x20 cm. and a small shoulder bag.  Wizz-Air just allows a cabin suitcase 42x32x25 cm and zero handbag. Me and my wife had 2 suitcases 50x38x20 and each a small shoulder bag with camera, toilet kit, book and newspaper for the trip. Because our cabin suitcases was too big we had to pay extra. But because we had the small shoulderbag we had two pieces of luggage, when only one was allowed. And we had to pay for that too. This cost us 260 Euro while plane tickets cost 22 Euro. When something is too cheap to b true – it is normally not true. This was no exeption.\n",

All though you fill out all the info booking on line, you have to wait in line to give all the information all over again to be hand written. Have gotten the same employee on drop off the last three times. Acts like he is doing you a royal favor by accepting your information and keys. He was almost done and my husband asked the shuttle bus to wait a minute and the driver said he couldn't. We got on the next one and the driver said we would leave in 5 minutes. Then he disappeared. When he got near again, I asked him when we were leaving as it had been over 5 minutes and he actually denied he said that! He wanted to wait for another couple who were at the check in desk.

Then, she emailed me at 7:00 am pst to tell me I couldn't have the loan due to my bank act being overdrawn in the month. I have overdraft protection plus another bank.

      "Had a great experience ordering my new theater chairs with 4seating.com.  I've never ordered theater chairs before and had no idea the different choices and options which were out there.  I worked with Alex Osorio on my order.  Alex was awesome!   He never pressured me into buying anything.  However, he made sure that I was aware of the various options that were available in purchasing theater seats.  Alex took a significant amount of time in understanding our new space to ensure that we were purchasing the proper seats for our room.  He even steered me clear of certain chairs knowing they wouldn't work for us even though those chairs were more expensive.    The process took a couple of weeks and Alex was always available to answer my questions and concerns at a moment's notice.  I've never purchased anything this expensive online, but Alex made the experience worthwhile.   He also made sure I got the best price for my purchase.  After my order, I e-mailed Alex asking questions regarding setting up the space for the chairs.  Alex replied within 5 minutes with the various specifications.  Can't say enough about 4seating and Alex.  I would highly recommend the Company and Alex to anyone.   Can't wait to get my new seats.\n",

I was a bit skeptical because I wasnt sure how the online learning would be due to its lack of human interaction compared to that of the classroom versions. But I was wrong. They have a 24/7 support that can help you whenever you are stuck in a course. The details and dept of information of the courses give you a holistic view of the entire topic. You end up getting deep insights into the said topic. I took a course of Digitial Marketing Certified Associate. With a little background in Digital Marketing, I slowly realized that the information given was up to date. They have projects in place too which you can complete with friendly timelines post the completion of your course. The course agenda takes you through the right path from basics to slightly complicated to highly detailed information. The website is fairly fast and the videos load instantly and do not buffer. A great site to do you specialized e-learning.\n",

      "I have ordered from this place before, and have never had a problem, so when I saw they had all 5 of my required textbooks for class, I jumped on that. That being said, I ave never had such poor service when dealing with any other site in general as I have with this particular order. I was given a tracking device, like most book renting companies do, and every once in a while I would check on it. That is until the tracking number stated my books were delivered... to Tennesesee. The last time I was in Tennessee was when I was about 14, and just passing through. I contacted the site via email (because this site does not offer a phone number) explaining my concerns. I received an email back essentially saying I could not complain about my books not being delivered until the estimated delivery time expired, even though my tracking number has updated to \"DELIVERED\". So I waited until I had time to contact them again (a day later) via chat. The customer service rep told me yes, the books were delivered to Tennessee, but he can't do anything about it (weather that be reimburse me or re-sending the textbooks) until the delivery date expired. He then told me to contact USPS about my shipment. After 45 minutes of talking to a robot, I finally got a person on the phone who told me the exact same this as everyone else, except he would try to resend the package, but I should just wait until the USPS in Tennessee calls me because they have my books. I called them, they say the books have been sent back to the original address from which they were shipped because they don't hold packages. Class has already started, and I need these books for homework and studying purposes, which is why I ordered them before class started. If I get my books (and I mean if) I sincerely doubt I will be renting from this site again.\n",

They also were the worst I've ever dealt with as far as communicating information. My account rep never returned my calls on the day before my flight and just \"went home\" leaving me in the lurch not knowing whether or not I'd be receiving a passport. The other person on their general line who claimed to stay late to assist me did not. There was very poor communication and I had to miss my flight. Easily one of the worst experiences out there.

After several weeks on the web site it was silently changed to C class. I noticed this occasionally when was trying to book another car for my friend. I have a mail thread with rentalcars customer support with official apologies and confirmation of internal error caused this incident. Plus I have the same mail confirmation from customer support that E class will be booked for me from another vendor. As a result today I received a notice that no one is responsible and nothing will be changed. And if I have any concerns I could cancel my booking (go far far away) or open customer support case AFTER the booking. So now I have no time to do anything by myself (no cars are available)\n",

Having a four year old in the house having a 3' x 2' open hole in the floor of my living room wasn't safe, so I needed a replacement ASAP.  I had no luck at local stores and went to google.  There I found Jedco Supply.  I made a quick call to them and talked a wonderful guy who was able to find out that they had one in the size I needed in stock and that if I ordered it that day that it would be to me in Norfollk VA within 2 days.  I talked to my husband and placed my order on Monday around 2 PM (it was so affordable to, shipping was $8!).  Sure enough today around 2 PM my new grill was waiting for me at my house.  About a 48 hour turn around which is exceptional.  The grill itself is well made and super sturdy (for all the foot traffic) and fit wonderfully.  I would definitely recommend Jedco to anyone.  :)\n",

      "With  persistence and patience with myself , Stephanie, my customer service representative found my frames.One of my four dogs  at Christmas ate my current frames.I called my optical company, and they said they would search for these particular frames.DEAD ENDS, with suppliers saying they were discontinued. I decided to search, myself... too many (1,038) websites that had these particular  frames,BUT discontinued.My daughter, who is an opthamologist, said she would help me search.After 3+ hours I came across RLE...my daughter,searched  only five minutes, came to me, and she tells me she found a website AND it was the same one I was on-TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,and they had the particular frames. I ordered them.I  finally after calling Replcement Lens Express-RLE (couldnt get through via phone) I wrote an e-mail to RLE.Stephanie replied,mentioning that CT had been receiving  horrific weather,and  it had affected business-I can relate-living In ND,It didnt  enter my mind, that this might be the reason. I thought I got scammed again-my Visa bank card was hacked and used at over seven stores after Christmas. Stephanie kapt in touch with me via e-mail, constantly...like I was an important customer. Finally, the frames arrived. My optical company couldnt believe it, and Im sure theyll remember your store name, because I raved about the customer service- Stephanie-and how she me feel at ease because they werent shipped RIGHT AWAY...she is the best!!!  If it hadnt been for the  severity of the weather my mind wouldnt have been thinking the worst... have been bed-ridden most of the time since November, so my mind thought of a few reasons for the delay.  It taught me a lesson-to be more patient, and if it hadnt been for Stephanie with CONSTANT status updates......and that all this is just DETAILS in the major course of our lifetimes.Thank you for EVERYTHING and thank Stephanie for her kind replies and updates.Sincerely, Judy A.

One gift we ordered was time sensitive and when I contacted cafepress because the order didn't arrive as expected, they quickly shipped a replacement, no questions asked (it ended up being a usps error- delivered to the wrong address). Prices are already reasonable and I can usually find a coupon online too. Overall very pleased!\n",

      "Scam company with crap-all service. Inflexible policies and CS basically told us we were completely out of luck and ~$400 because deposits are only accepted through credit card upon collection of rental car, no other options. Neither cash nor mastercard/visa debit are acceptable. So too bad even if they were happy to collect $400 paid through debit. SCAM COMPANY. Completely unprofessional business practices and I highly advise all to stay far away from cartrawler. Stick to a more reputable business!\n",

I have tried calling customer services, using the number listed for  customer service on the website which is unobtainable. I then sent an e-mail to which I got a response advising me to change my password. I have changed my password three times today and am still unable to request a return. As this is the only way to return goods it looks as if I will miss the 14 day dealine within which returns have to be requested. Am beginning to think this is a ploy to prevent goods being returned. First time using this company and I won't be using them again. Can anyone advise alternative means of returning goods to them?\n",

When I called customer service they promised to resend my corrected order with upgraded shipping, which is great but also what you would expect right before Christmas. What irked me though is, that they seemed completely unapologetic for their mistake. Not once have I heard the phrase \"sorry for the inconvenience\" or the like. With so many other similar companies out there, I will not be returning to CafePress again.\n",

      "So far, so good.   It was a serendipitous find, not quite where we had started looking.   The booking process was quite easy.   However, we were charged for the rental before we actually got the contract.  The contract listed many restrictions that were not indicated on the website when we booked.  Did the restrictions change our minds?  No,   I think that if a property comes with restrictions (no personal watercraft, such as a kayak, when the house is on a lake), well, those restrictions should be prominently displayed prior to booking.\n",

      "I first switched to Eagle Optics over a dozen years ago when I branched out from Bird watching to Butterflies and Dragonflies, which required a much closer focus. I started light with a 7 x 35 which they don't make anymore and once convinced of the quality I bumped myself up to Ranger 10 x 50 which I have carried ever since. In terms of bang for the bucks I don't think you can do any better, I use my binoculars pretty roughly. I don't do this on purpose I'm just not the kind of person who is going to use a case and eye cups etc. They need to live mostly on my pick up seat with whatever else is there. My original 10 X 50's are in for the third time for a free cleaning and minor repair. I talked with a rep explaining my needs and decided to order a new pair of 10 X 50's and use the old pair as a back up or to lend a visitor.  Hopefully I will get to see my 600th life bird for the lower 48 with my new pair once they arrive  as I am just 8 birds away.  Birds, butterflies, Odes I don't think you can go wrong with Eagle Optics. F,M, Stiteler\n",

      "Our Home Care agency is a medium-sized non-profit Home Care provider (400 clients) in the Pacific Northwest.  Two years ago we moved to ClearCare after struggling with an antiquated telephony system, and many failed attempts to find a Home Care program management system that took full advantage of cloud computing and mobile technology.  ClearCare has done all that and more--it has provided us with the opportunity to reach more clients with fewer staff, with much greater integrity and thoroughness.  It is difficult to overstate the magnitude of the change--for the first time we were able to track caregiver activities in real-time, to communicate with them easily and generate dozens of reports with a click of a few buttons.  I have been most impressed with their customer service and responsiveness--they seem to understand that a product like ClearCare defines an entire agency's workflow and culture, and have worked hard to understand our specific needs and create a sense of community among ClearCare providers.  I can't recommend their product highly enough.\n",
      "Thrift books is one of the best companies I have ever ordered anything from. They are fast, honest, and just generally an excellent company. All of my orders are shipped speedily and I get them in no more than a week including business days when they are shipped from across the country, no matter if it's holiday season or not. The prices are so competitive, I have never found a cheaper source of books. I have order test prep books for $3!!!! The original price of which would normally be at least $20. The books come in Acceptable, Good, Very Good, Like New, and Brand New condition.

Somehow it ended up in the hands of postNL, a Netherlands based carrier.  Their last tracking update was 8 days ago.  I contacted HK and asked to cancel the order and give me a refund.  They said they could not do that until 40 days had elapsed and the shipment still not arrived.  Absolutely unacceptable considering it was shipped \"Air Mail\"!\n",

      "I purchased a Laptop $600.- from HP (HP Laptop 15Z000) I am disappointed. Shipping was good. After 2 weeks the Laptop turned it self off. Called Customer service, they pushed on me a 3 Year warranty and the McAffee virus program this cost me over $200.-. They told me after that we can fix the problem. After several days and hours with a technician I think the problem was fixed. Then I had a problem with my touchpad, still have the problem. Called HP, I thought I had a warranty, not so the $200.- 3 year warranty was only for software problems. Now I have a hardware problem. It is not covered under this warranty. My touchpad is very sensitive, tried to adjust it with software, no luck. often the pointer jumps around, then deleting in the middle of writing a letter or email half of it and had to rewrite again. Opens up automatically websites. The touchpad left and right click is horrible, have to touch only a small section of the right or left button so it get recognized. The turn on button is not good at all. It is a small rectangle bar. When you push this button you don't know, did it turn on the Laptop or not. Because it takes a while until the hp logo appears on the screen. No other sign of life. A round start button with a light coming on would be great. I would not recommend Hp to buy a computer. Customer service tries to sell you only warranties. Searched online what I should do with my Touchpad. Recommendation is Live with it, because when you send it to Hp repair you have to deal on the end only with more problems.\n",

Living alone she tried to get herself up but broke her leg and had a minor stroke in the process.  At 4:00 in the morning she was on her own to move herself to the phone which was five feet away.  At 9:00 a.m. she finally arrived at the phone and called 911 for herself and then started calling family.  The family cringes at the thought that of what would have happened had she not been able to move at all?  How many days would we have waited to go see why she wasn't answering our calls? What would we have found?  Thank God we never need to know the answers to those questions.\n",

      "I have used Postsnap on several occasions now and I am very impresssd with the quality of their product and their service. The website is very easy to use and the cards are usually posted within 24-48 hrs. In this time of text, emails, twitter etc, people rarely receive things through the mail so the recipients of the cards have been thrilled to receive them. The thing I especially love is its no inconvenience to me. No sorting through postcards, no finding a post office or letterbox, no buying stamps. I can sit on the beach sipping a pina colada, whilst going online to Postsnap.  Choose the card, upload my chosen photos, write a few words click send. The price includes the postage and, because the cards are printed and posted in the UK, they arrive within more or less the next day. Perfect!\n",
      "Easy and quick.\n",
      "Policy Genius provided upfront and transparent pricing after just a few short questions. They also communicated with me through the entire process, making sure I knew what to expect. They provided service well above and beyond what I received from other agencies when requesting a quote and starting the process. That’s why I chose them and I am extremely happy that I did.  I highly recommend them.\n",

      "I was really surprised to find these new on clearance. I have no doubt that I was the first one to play the 5th Dimension single from 1970. The unadvertised ELO pic sleeve was a great bonus. Vinyl singles from the 90s at such a low price? Blows my mind. Very satisfied with my first purchase. The packaging was perfect and shipped fast. I like the catalogs as extra padding...felt like I was opening a package from an old skool music club. I'll definitely be shopping again soon.\n",
      "I chose Veterans United for a no money down VA Loan and they did a fantastic job from start to finish.  My loan officer, Daniel Heggarty, walked us through the process from pre-qualification, approval to closing.  They helped me find an agent and made sure the process was kept moving along.  When we started having delays with the listing agent, he got on it with both the listing and our agent to get things done.  We even got a check back from VU for using the agent they recommended and we got money back at closing too.  I really couldn't have asked for anything more.  We love our new house!\n",

Expecting to be turned down and to hear heavy sighs upon my arrival, I just wanted to see what was wrong with my tire on my drivers side of my Infiniti for my safety. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by Sergio and treated as if I was his first customer of the day -- when I was definitely his last so close to closing. This is a huge deal for me being a general manager of a company myself. Joe also stayed passed his shift, to help me and ensure I was completely satisfied. I had previously negative experiences with Al Horan at this location, and I stayed away, but because of Sergio and Joe I will go out of my way to now go back to this town fair tire. Thank you for your exceptional service, and you now have a customer for life.\n",

It was just for home reference, and a good price, but I was sort of surprised that this book was even sold. I'm glad I wasn't planning to give it as a gift, as I was one of the other used books I ordered, that was in great shape! So, sort of mixed results for me from my order. : /\n",

I got my book within 1 week of ordering it. Overall this website is perfect. I wish they had more books though because I would definitely purchase or rent them all from here.\n",
      "The service seems good but can be improved, especially in the case of rebooking fix that as in my regrets not having received your help to quickly locate a new reservation with the correction of an inadvertent error of mine, and that after two days there had myself to track abruptly canceling other initial reservation having no favorable response from Sky, to finish booking again with Sky, after having canceled the initial operation and insist that prices had similar or more favorable than the that was to change, I just proposed a very high overhead to make the change, which was not real.\n",

After all of that, my father in law received the wrong part. Again, when my father in law tried to contact TJ to arrange for the return of the wrong part he was unsuccessful on several attempts to make contact with TJ. They are currently waiting for an actual reply other than the automated email response. Your communication process is terribly lacking and needs to be remedied if you want to continue to be successful. I found Parts Geek for my father in law since he was having a hard time finding his part and your site showed you had them in stock. His truck is still inoperable and I feel like I let him down by putting him in contact with you. I hope you can resolve his issues quickly, especially since TJ sent the wrong part in the first place.\n",

      "American Frame has a wide selection of frames in wood and metal, and some unusual colors in metal. I appreciated being able to get some sample pieces so that I could be sure which color worked best with my artwork and walls. I think it's great that you can get a kit -- frame, acrylic, and backing board -- for any size you order; that simplifies things and it's much easier than having to buy each piece separately. And they even sent a print catalog with my order! The frames went together quickly, and look great. \r\n",

My son purchased and sent to me Voltron (1985 Modern) issue #3 as a gift; so I needed issues 1 and 2 to complete the issue set.  I am a die-hard Voltron and retro 80's toy fan.  MyComicShop made the sale transaction efficient and packaged and shipped both comics ordered with the utmost care; I received both in near mint condition.  I highly recommend purchasing from MyComicShop and definitely look forward to doing business with this company in the near future!  Thank you MyComicShop for a pleasant buying experience!\n",

Their website is well organized and their prices are competitive. I have found Bookbyte to be a trustworthy and reliable vendor.\n",
      "Service and selection was very good. Staff helpful without being pushy. As a big man 6'3, 300lbs, with wide shoulders, long arms even for my height, and thick legs shopping can be hard at times especially for clothes that are in style. The one issue, one that has continued after the  name change of your store, I believe is an unfair mark up of prices. The practice is one that takes advantage of mine and others' body types. Yes some of us are overweight, but for myself even if I possessed less then 10% body fat I would still have to shop at stores like DXL. The price markup clearly takes advantage of our situation.\n",

They were nice enough to give me the extra 5% when I emailed but then I noticed it moved to 55% the next day.  I was a little frustrated but didn't feel like following up again.  I wrote a somewhat negative review on here and they immediately emailed me to resolve the problem.  They ended up giving me the extra 5% off.  I wish more companies acted this quickly and appropriately.\n",

      "This is my first purchase of a global phone and SIM, and Telestial made the experience very quick and easy.  Telestial was highly-recommended by several reviewers on multiple web sites.  The Telestial website provided thorough information on their offerings including phones, SIM card options, rates and helpful user guides.  I purchased an ekit Economy Pack for my son who is traveling to the Middle East.  The package includes an ekit 4C Dual Sim phone and Passport SIM Card.  The calling rates are much cheaper than our Sprint service, and the phone is a nice, basic text and talk phone which is exactly what he needed.  He has used the phone several times already from Jordan with great call quality and reliable signal.  So far the experience has been great, and I would highly recommend Telestial for global travel communications.\n",

All of the items were upgraded to a cost of $110.  When I spoke to the agent I was very specific about the color and bear and all was confirmed.  The next day I received a call to return their call. After holding 45 minutes I was told that some of the lavender flowers were not available.  I ok substitution on some of the flowers and reconfirmed the medium sized teddy and the lavender vase.  What was delivered was a substandard bouquet of mixed colored flowers with a polka dot ribbon and a stuffed pony fit for a five year of with only one ballon.   I contacted Avas and again held for over  45 minutes.  Their resolution was to give me a $20 credit!  My next step is to file a complaint with the better business bureau.\n",

So my grandson askes me where are the soccer balls? That is his favorite sport, so he doesn't use it very often.

I was confused a few times about why my Co-Signers name was in the #1 position and mine was in the #2 position, my co-signer didn't really like that idea since we clearly comunicated with them that the tools belong to me, so this created some confusion and a few days of delayed e-mails. Still waiting to receive my tool order, and then I will be able to review products. Other than this I was very satisfied with Product options, Prices, and Features.\r\n",

      "I have been shopping online with Thriftbooks for just about a year now after my eldest daughter found out about it at school.  It is a wonderful site for finding quality used books at a great price!  We are usually shopping for books for school or research, but Thriftbooks has a very large selection of many genres!  I particularly love the wish list feature, which allows you to be contacted if they do not currently have a book in stock.  Even the most obscure title I've been looking for has been located on this site.  I also love their fast shipping, which is usually free depending on your order total (it's easy to get free shipping with so many great books to choose from!).  I will use this site often, and highly recommend them!\n",

      "I purchased 1 week of meals for my mother who lives on the East coast. Even though there were some issues with meal date availability, I was called and informed at every delay and offered an out. My mother was very happy with all the meals delivered except the shrimp with linguini which she felt was soggy. I plan on sending her more meals.\n",
      "After 5 years, my secretary/receptionist decided to give me 1 week notice she was leaving. I panicked and put an posted an ad for a receptionist. After reviewing over 300 resumes in a 24 hour period and interviewing 6 people, I decided to check out a \"virtual receptionist\". I checked around and then called Servcorp at their Irvine office. I spoke to both Bow and Erika. I decided to go with them for a trial period and now, after just a little over 30 days, I cannot be happier. Both are very professional and Bow answers my calls very professionally. She screens my calls for me and if I do not want the call at that time or I am out, the call goes to my voice mail, which in turn sends me an email with a voice message attached so I can listen to the message. After their normal hours (M-F 8:30-5:30), the calls go straight to my voicemail, which Bow very professionally recorded. And the best thing of all, I am saving over $20,000 a year on not having to pay an employee. I actually spoke to my prior receptionist a few days ago and she is not happy where she is working now and looking for a new job again. I think she wanted her job back, which I would have given her had I not found Servcorp. So happy with their services!\n",

      "On June 8 I bought three books to be given as a present to the keynote speakers in a Conference, one week before the conference. Just after accepting the order, I realized that I didn't choose the express shipment option (which is in my opinion not clearly visible), and I sent an e-mail to orders-HD-individuals@springer.com, asking if it were possible to change the shipment option or, at least, to know if the books would arrive in one week, to be able to react and place a new express order.  One and a half day after, I received an apparently automatic response telling  \"Please be informed that upon checking on our system, we could no longer change the address as well as the mode of shipment since the book was already delivered on June 6, 2014\" , a wrong date, before the order date, which was really sent on June 10 according to the invoice and, what is worst, no answer to my question about the delivery time.

      "From the beginning, the broker selling the boat was slow to respond to requests for info, pics, etc. When we actually set up a time to view and inspect the boat, I inquired if we could do the closing the same day if the boat was acceptable, as it was a 6 hour trip to get to the boat, and I wanted to avoid making this trip twice just to sign my name and hook up to the boat. Broker said twice it wasn't possible to close on the same day, then the morning of said maybe it was possible....back and forth. After we saw the boat and we're waiting (again) to hear from the broker about closing, I went around him and spoke to the closing coordinator, who actually new what she was doing and said it would be no problem to close same day (apparently the broker had no idea of this.) We also wasted about 1.5 hours because the broker didn't make an effort to have the boat delivered to the closing office as we requested- which instead causes us to travel out of our way twice when we didn't need to. There was no customer service from the broker- nothing was done by him to make the process as seamless as possible. I feel he didn't have any experience in sales or in customer service. We were able to close the same day, which is not the norm for this company. With a different broker I would give them another shot.\n",

      "I would absolutely recommend Saatchi Art for both experienced and new collectors, adding that it is the best international platform for artists in the earlier stages of their careers and so, because of this, artists are very careful to conduct themselves most professionally when working with Saatchi so as to maintain good relationships with them.  So you can expect that in general artists will represent their work accurately on the website, prepare and ship their work carefully, and sincerely anticipate the buyer will love the work as much as he or she hoped in that moment when the package is finally opened and the artwork first seen by its new owner.\n",

For our two 5-year old grandchildren who didn't know how to bike yet, a trailer was attached to one of the adult bikes and they too enjoyed the tour.  Our tour guide, Kirstie, was fantastic!  She had a lovely Scottish lilt and made the history of Paris come alive!  It felt like she was just relating a story that happened yesterday.  I learned so much more about  Paris, French history, they way Paris as a city was planned than I ever had during past trips.  And biking around made us feel like local Parisians.  Kirstie took good care in guiding us safely through the busy streets of Paris.  Everyone in my family thinks that the Bike tour was the best!\n",

Got a call the next morning to tell me that the item is not in stock and it will be several weeks before it's re-stocked.  I was working with a deadline.  He suggested that I try a larger size that they had but it would not work with the door I had.  He then suggested that I use another brand (well known name) that they had in stock with the finish and size I needed.  I recognized the name and thought it would be more expensive (it was) but was told that because it was their mistake in their inventory system that they would give it to me at the same price as the original but not in stock - hinges.  Because of the deadline I had I was worried about the timing as I had already lost a day.  I was shocked when I received it via Fedex within a few days.  'm sure they lost money on this sale.

      "I have been with ClearCare for a while and am very happy with my decision to leave my previous scheduling platform. What prompted the move was a lack of communication from my previous vendor. What made me choose ClearCare over the other platforms I was exploring was the fact that the system allows for my staff to be more self-sufficient, thus taking strain off my office. Before ClearCare, we were using multiple platforms for various purposes- one for scheduling, another for telephony, a website for charting visit notes, etc. The move to ClearCare has drastically cut down a lot of my time spent on administrative tasks. CC is also very responsive regarding inquiries and action items, and I love how they seek customer feedback on future planning and innovation.\n",

      "I am in agreement with the negative reviews. After I made a flight reservation a screen popped up offering  me a rental car for a good price. It was a very specific. It made an offer of a weekly rate at a specific dollar amount. It did not say “as low as”, or any of the other things you expect when they don’t intend to honor the rate. When I tried to reserve the car the link took me to a page with much higher prices. When I received my email confirmation the same offer popped up offering a rental car for a good price. Again, when I tried to click on the link it took me to a page with much higher prices. I wasted two hours on the phone speaking to customer support asking them to honor their offer. What does it say about a company where the support people are all named Al or Alice or Albert? They don’t even give you their real names but they do give you many illogical excuses for why they can’t honor their offers. This is clearly a dishonest and dishonorable company and I would not recommend them to anyone.\n",

These are expensive socks so I would not expect them to rip apart along the seams so quickly. I bought eight pairs so I will have to see how the rest of them hold up. For now, I am loving the remaining seven pairs of socks and will probably buy more.\n",

Both of our phones were on the night stand between us, so I started looking for this phone I thought may have been left by a previous person. Looked under the curtains, edge of the bed and between the mattress....nothing.  A bit later, Mom says, \"No, I'm fine.\" I ask her what she is talking about. She says, \"You asked me if I was warm enough.\"  Oh no I didn't! I hadn't said anything at all.  During the night (about 3 am) I wake up to see a dark shadow at the end of my Mom's bed. It disappeared quickly. Then to top if off, later I wake up to pressure on my bed, like someone had sat on it!! This happened about 4 times!  I've never experienced that type of thing before, so I was a bit unnerved by it!  I'm wondering if the remodeling a few doors down stirred something up?\n",

I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy my setting. I called Al and again, he made me feel comfortable purchasing from him. I had nothing to lose.

Thank you Al!!!!\n",

I would have to go in and pay.  They did not act like they cared if I ordered the part.  I went online and found this part.  All I did was put in the make and model and they pulled up the part.  I was afraid it would not be right but it came in with a black cover.  A friend of mine put it on in 5 minutes.  I saved  $164.00 and did not have to get off work to order.  I would recommend to try this site before you pay big bucks to dealership\n",

The service was quick and I had no problems. They even gave me a passport cover, bonus! I do wish, however that their website was more user friendly with clearer instructions and easier navigation.\n",

Arrived at my destination and GoldCar wanted to charge me extra to take the car i booked because of insurance. I was very frustrated as they wanted to charge me over 100euros for this.

Computer seems to run ok now and I haven't noticed some of the script errors we had before. I haven't used the computer, as usual, as we have had company!

      "The only critisism is that you have extra payments on collection...full tank of petrol up front 72euros and extra insurance (for windscreen and wheel cover) appaently not covered on the policy? 42 euros a one off payment, other wise you have to leave a huge 400 euro deposit, this came to 114 euros, £93. They have a pay for a full tank of petrol bring the car back empty policy which if you dont plan to do a lot of driving then you have paid out for petrol you do not use. I have used other companies where you collect the car full and return the car full, that way you only pay for the petrol you use, which i feel is a fairer way of doing it?\n",

Just now I tried calling a friend and there was an automated message that youve reached the max limit of unique numbers you could call. ARE YOU SERIOUS? I bought this thing so that I could make non commerical calls to family and friends back in India. Why would you restrict this to a few numbers. Whatever dumb person in your company has made this decision let them know that Indians have wider social group and we are a community oriented group. If you dont fix my account to take this restriction off NOW, I am straight away disconnecting mine and three other similar connections. This aint worth it.\n",

      "Now that we are a few months into Sling TV, I would like to begin with how we are overall happy with Sling TV.  We are also glad that your option is available as I was extremely happy to get rid of cable years ago and missed the regular TV options.  With that said, we do believe that there are a few improvements that we hope are considered.  We could not give your service a higher rating at this time. Thank you for allowing us to voice our opinion.  Have a great day. Carolyn & Family.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Constant interruptions and losing signal.  This is not due to my internet speed and/or modem.  I have high speed internet with Verizon Fios and works very well with my other streaming channels. When I call your customer service it's always a Sling TV issue.  Very frustrating. \n",
      "2. Remote needs to have more button options to navigate faster, like a one touch \"last channel\" option. \n",
      "3. Would be nice to have extra buttons on the remote in order to \"Preset\" channels we watch a lot.  Or, better yet, a screen we can navigate to that allows this option. \n",
      "4. The \"OK/Enter\" button should be in the center of the arrows buttons (up, down, left, right), not below it for easier access.  \n",
      "5. The \"Guide\" bar should be set up differently where we don't have to toggle all the way to the right or left through every channel to get to the channel that we want to watch.  \n",
      "6. Not enough local channels.\n",
      "7. Would be nice to have a \"DVR\" type function/option for shows/sports/movies we may not be able to watch at the time it's on.  This option should be included in the Orange/Blue option since we are paying for the higher tier package already.  Maybe this would entice more customers to pay for the higher tier package which would benefit Sling TV monetarily. \n",
      "8. How about a delete option to remove some channels that we don't want to watch or never watch that is on the guide bar.  For example, we are never going to watch \"Campus TV\" or the Spanish Channels, just to name a few. Waste of our money and space on the guide bar and again, the frustration of having to scroll through every one of those unwanted channels.\n",
      "9. How about offering bundled packages for Sports instead of one price for NFL, another for NHL, another for MLB, etc.  Also, I would pay a little more to be able to watch our local teams on the days they are actually playing, instead of watching those games days later.  By then we know who won or lost, so what's the point?\n",
      "10. How about rearranging the guide. Let's put the sports channels near the other sports channels, the movie channels with other movie channels, the news channels with the other news channels, the regular entertainment channels with the other entertainment channels, etc and so on and so on, instead of the jumbled mess that it is on the guide. Example:  NFL channel is currently all the way to the left and ESPN on the far opposite side of the guide bar.  Again, it brings back the frustration of having to scroll through every channel from one end of the spectrum to the other.  There's no rhyme or reason for how the channels are set up currently.\n",
      "11. Maybe place numbers on the remotes and then assign \"channel\" numbers to the programs in a guide to navigate easier and faster. You know, like a regular remote? Only having the up, down, left, right buttons is not enough and very primitive.\n",
      "Found the product and prices at Parts Geek to be first rate. Items arrived quickly and were a perfect fit. The price I paid for a new alternator was what local auto parts stores wanted for a rebuilt.\n",

      "Found a great service, but didn't have a local for another service I need.\n",
      "They gave us options of unit sizes and locations on the property. Found one near another unit we already have. Personally took us to view the unit. Explained everything very clearly.

      "I shop quite significantly online so I have a lot of experience with great retailers.  Your store misses the mark a bit in terms of taking care of customers and the experience.  Case in point I spent $400 on my first order.  A coupon for 20% off comes out a few days after I order via an email from you (I just got my dresses today).  When I call they confirm the coupon will work on my dresses but they cannot provide a price adjustment (which would be almost $80).  Grrrr. How crappy is that when u send me a discount code right after I order.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked about sending back and reordering with discount I was informed that i will pay 10% restock. My thought is now to send them back, paying 10% to restock and to reorder the same things again. It will still save me $40 and cause you hassle handling return. That will make me feel better.\n",
      "\n",

Maybe a system where I can enter my parameters and it gives me all of my choices paired with the right screws, plates, etc. so I can choose them easier.

More important was the fact that someone called me within just a couple hours of placing my order to go over an issue with me.  I don't expect they call everyone, but I had a large order and there was a slight issue that they resolved with me.  I was very impressed.  I received everything when it was expected and it was packaged well with no damage etc.  And I felt the prices were very good.

      "well i ordered some stuff to restore a truck its a 1959 ford f100 and i needed brake drums brake cylinders brake shoes and some hardware, pretty much standard stuff. so i ordered it all and i had ordered two front drums and two rear drums. but what they had sent me was 4 rear brake drums. then when i contacted the company about exchanging them for the front drums that i needed, they insisted that i was wrong and that they were right. no matter that i sent them a picture of the 4 brake drums that all had the same part number. the part number on the 4 i had was 123.65000 and i needed two of part number BD160. they then told me that they were out of the ones that i wanted and that they sent me two front ones at a lower price for the inconvenience. now i cannot get ahold of them at all, and the last thing i was told was that i was stuck with an extra set of rear brake drums and that i was going to have to purchase the front ones (that i had already paid for) \r\n",

I had rung Gala Hotels head office specifically to double check that upon our arrival we had a twin double but when we arrived at the hotel it was a double bed not a twin. Bit disappointing however The Hotel were fantastic and soon sorted it so wasn't a problem.

They emailed me that standard service was not available and had an option for a full refund or they would send a zip file with instructions to unlock by usb cable. I opted for usb  The instructions could of been better; they lack diagrams(screenshots). it probably would be good if DrSim created a YouTube video to complement instructions. They warn you final step can take 20 minutes to get codes to unlock but they don't tell it will be embedded in the program. You expect screen will change displaying the codes but doesn't  the codes show in red Also they indicate \"DeFreeze\" code but actually shows as \"Freeze\" After entering two codes nothing happen so i tried a phone restart and did at one point  think I had bricked the phone as it got locked in a android menu screen. After several  attempts to reboot or power down it remain locked on android menu. I gave up for about hour to find the phone still locked.

We skipped all the long lines and were treated just like VIP members. Many areas that usually had to pay additional to get in were almost all included.

      "I sold a dress and accurately listed and described the dress (a designer wedding gown lightly used). I even went above and beyond with the seller to send additional videos etc. before the purchase so she knew exactly what she was getting. She was aware there was a no return policy, and but apparently after receiving it decided she wanted to return it so she damaged the dress and sent it back to tradesy returns who took it without communicating ANYTHING to me, the seller. They took the return citing it as \"misrepresented\" on my listing. I received the dress back with new damage from when it was in their possession/the sellers possession and have not been compensated for my sale. \n",
      "TRADESY IS A THIEF!!! I'm now out $75 from shipping and insuring the shipment from sending it to the buyer AND now have what was a beautiful wedding dress with minor wear that has ADDITIONAL DAMAGE AFTER TRADESY HAD IT and they are offering NO compensation for their mistake. In fact, they haven't even responded to the four emails I have sent them today asking for a manager to call me. This issue is NOT resolved and they should be sued. I'm assuming they only gave the buyer credit on the site after her return which means they keep the $1100 from my sale and give me a newly damaged dress back. \n",
      "I sent proof showing the difference in the dress I sent to the buyer with what they returned to me and this is the best part... LAURA FROM TRADESY then said it looked exactly like the pictures from the listing which proves it was like that before.

Many factors contribute to my rating, primarily search result relevance, convenience, and speed.The search tool was exceptional in all three aspects. I searched for \"savings account\" to see the best financial institutions nearby. Not only did the search tool return a gigantic list of banks, but also options that matched my expectations. There is a nice filter within the search tool, so I will get the best results. I can also switch from specific categories, such as CD/Savings, Checking, and Mortgages. I can even search for answers to my questions under the community tab. Overall, I am very impressed by WalletHub's search tool!\n",

      "Once again, we've ordered a product from Sceenprinting.com and they have fallen short. The product was a Little Buddy 120V conveyor dryer. The product itself was easy to assemble. The problem is the company fails to mention that the plug is not a standard 110-120V plug. It specifically says, \"Versatile 120v standard power supply\" and also says, \"Heater plug type: NEMA 5-20P.\" But the heater plugs into a central control panel. The \"standard power supply\" (ie., standard plug) is not standard at all. You need a 5-15P To 5-20R Adapter (20A minimum). A good one will run about $15 on Amazon. This may not seem like a big deal, but after three botched orders from Screenprinting.com, it IS a big deal because every time we've set out to get things set up, each error has caused us a week in loss time.\n",

Much to my surprise what arrived in the mail was an all white scaled razor. What a let down! When I called the rep told me they don't know what is being sent out (?) they just get them from Dovo and ship them to the customer. Well if  your going to sell something to someone maybe you should know what it is your selling? Hope to get this straightened out.\n",

      "I am very disappointed in Gilt. Zulily which I thought wasn't as big as Gilt delivers a hundred times better customer service. I ordered a father's day gift, a pair of shoes (Order #86480346) on June 10, 2017. My order shipped on June 14, I never received them. Based on details from the tracking number, the package got to my city (actually had the 'out for delivery' update so you can imagine my over excitement like a groom waiting for his bride) but were sent back to sender for reasons I do not know. Using the tracking number I was given when the order shipped, the last update was on the 25th of June with delivery still pending. I have sent emails and called and Gilt representatives insist I have to wait till they receive the returned package before I get my refund of $288.33! Why I should wait indefinitely for my money for a fault that is not mine boggles my mind! Almost a month after I placed my order, an email from one of Gilt's reps on July 5 stated that I could wait for as long as 3 MONTHS & if I didn't get a refund after this time frame I could get in touch again! Ludicrous! Why should a brand with integrity hold on to my money till they receive the returned package. So now I don't have my money nor do I have my purchase and then I should keep paying interest on this money Gilt has. I wonder what will happen if this returned order somehow gets missing in transit and they never receive it, I honestly doubt they will notice. I don't think anyone at Gilt customer service is abreast of this type of failed transaction. The burden seems to fall totally on the unfortunate customer that is caught up in this unfortunate circumstance to chase for a refund.\n",

Ryan was great and provided great communication and a quick turn around.  We selected the product, submitted the artwork and what we wanted printed (we went with 16gb jump drives).  Ryan quickly prepared a draft for approval and was able to begin having the order processed.  We started process on a Thursday morning, approval by early afternoon, payment in the afternoon (was real easy to submit payment), and I received the product by Tuesday the following week, which was pretty good in my opinion, especially over a holiday weekend.  This was a fast, easy, and pleasant transaction.  Ryan's communication and support was great.  We will definitely look to Ryan and Flashbay for our future needs.\r\n",

Price and delivery time were very reasonable.  I did struggle a bit with actually mounting my canvas in the frame but referred to AF's website where they had video demos which provided some tips.

      "When I ordered the buttons, it was my first time ordering buttons.  I was depending on the salesperson's advice as to color, size, pin or magnet, etc.  I've done a lot of newspaper ads, etc. and generally I will use a bright yellow background to make the colors pop so that they grab your attention.  In this case I depended on the buttons that were displayed in your ad and ended up getting colors that didn't contrast enough to make them gain attention and make them easy to read at a short distance.  I was not pleased with the performance of the buttons due to the colors used.  I had two managers at my casino mention the same thing to me.\n",

      "As a special educator in Texas I find myself at odds with the school system for many reasons. The fact that my daughter has dyslexia and ADHD does not help this fact, nor does the fact I work with students who have special needs. Because of this, after my daughter had been in two different schools, and with my experience in several schools and districts, I knew I had to make homeschool work for her.  I enrolled my daughter in January 2017 in Enlightium, with the hope that she would have fewer stressors from school work, so she wouldn't shut down or flat out refuse to do her work.\n",
      "\n",
      " Her first semester was a huge success. The curriculum was challenging for her, but not too, difficult. She was able to receive the one-on-one attention from me or a family friend who worked with her. She was also able to have the work chunked into manageable parts, so she could complete it in a timely manner and spend less time on school work. Also, since the work was online there were no more worries about whether or not it would get turned in to the teacher. I'm not saying any of this went off without a hitch, but it was much better than her spending 8 hours a day in an environment that overwhelmed her and caused a significant amount of anxiety to perform without the assistance she needed.\n",

      " Another bonus for both of us is the way Christianity and Biblical teachings are integrated into all subjects. It is done so in a matter-of-fact way, and points out that others may have different beliefs. The Bible is also used to back up all of the teachings and effects of believing or not believing in a loving  God.   \n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot say how grateful I am that Enlightium Academy is available. If you are a parent who wants you child to succeed and excel then I believe Enlightium will work for you and your child if you are willing to work together.

SCAM!!! She is under age, not old enough to join any membership that costs money! She just wanted to order some nice leggings.

      "Years of trail running and mogul skiing had left my knees in continual pain. When my Ortho doc had no solution and suggested it was time to give up running and skiing, I was devastated. Having heard of stem cell therapy, I made the easy decision to give it a try. My first treatment fall 2015 provided great results with pain free bump skiing that winter. Spring running revealed some dull pain though, so I had a second treatment summer 2016. The result is amazing! I'm running and skiing as fast and as hard as ever at 62 years old. This science is very real and incredibly effective.\n",

      "After reading reviews from other buyers, I was relatively certain this was going to be a horrible experience, but I just couldn't resist the price. $42.00 for The Insanity workout set?  They normally retail for $170!!!  That's an insane discount and they even threw in free shipping.  They had a pretty good return policy, so I figured if it didn't work, I'd just return it.  It came two days later (via FedEx) in a beachbody box (they are the company who manufactures the workout DVDs).  I opened it to find exactly what was promised...a brand new, factory sealed set with all the fixings.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the package did contain an order receipt for a value much higher than what I paid.  The slip does note that it is an order receipt and not an invoice.  I checked my bank statements and I wasn't charged the higher price (which was the full price for the set and $130 more than what I paid).  In the end...I couldn't be happier. I would DEFINITELY recommend.\n",

I called again and asked for an explanation, and they said \"according to my tracking number, the package is untraceable). I ask for the tracking number to check myself, and the guy gets audibly flustered and starts snapping back at me, changing his story to \"USPS never shipped your package so there is no tracking number\".

I bought my tickets to a Green Bay Packer game in June, I was travelling from Toronto Canada to Green Bay Wisconsin, and finally received my tickets via email (you charged me for shipping) 2 days before I got on a plane to go.  You guys never notified me that my tickets were available it was me calling your company, and finally getting somebody on the phone, I believe his name is Tyler who is able to get me the tickets emailed. I will never use your company again, and I will definitely be telling people I know never to use your company. A brutal experience, I’m only Being honest. \n",
