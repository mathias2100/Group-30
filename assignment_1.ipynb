The salesperson on the phone, (J.P.), asked if I would mind telling him why I chose this brand of tire. I filled him in on the details, and he again asked if I would mind if he could suggest another tire brand. I informed him I didn't mind, and he suggested Nexen tires. I told him I had never heard of them and he qualified his suggestion with a wide array of facts on this tire brand. I was impressed with his knowledge and told him I would take a chance and purchase the tires he suggested. He told me I had 30 days to make my mind up but was sure I would love them. I told J.P. I would be back in a couple of hours to pick the car up. Fifty-seven minutes later, I got a text informing me my car was ready! Four-wheel alignment included. When I picked my car up, J.P. was busy, so I didn't have the chance to thank him and tell him I was impressed with the timing and service. After driving less than 1/8th mile, I was sold. These tires were MUCH more plush than my former tires. The service & price sold me on Town Fair tire. The quality and performance of the tire was the icing on the cake.\n",

I informed them that I lost 100 dollars because the dealer charged me for taking apart my car only to discover I had showed up with the wrong part and they simply did not care and never offered to help.

So I escalated to PayPal, I provided all evidence to prove that seller has received my returned goods, but unfortunately PayPal keep telling me that they couldn't verify the product has sent to the seller, so denied me and closed my case. I lose $2400,  but they take it like it's no big deal. Their Customer service sucks , and remember they don't fight for you, or protect you at all.

      "At the meeting where we had purchased our Travel Advantage Network vacations from Sundance, I distinctly recall the man giving his spiel say \"if you're looking for hotels we're not the place for you. We only do resorts\". \n",
      " Now,  ask yourself this question: when you think of a \"resort\", do you think of paying for all your toiletries & daily necessities (toilet paper, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand wash, dish soap, dishwasher detergent, laundry detergent, batteries, cleaning products, trash bags, napkins, paper towels...)? How about doing all the same chores you do at your own home (or worse like washing towels & your clothing at a coin operated laundry room that is up a flight of stairs & down a lengthy hallway)? How about taking out your trash & having No cleaning or up keeping service?  Does that all sound like a \"resort\"?? \n",
      " We have 6 kids, teenager to toddler. We were told we'd have the 2 units next to the playground and the teenager could fish the pond on the premises. Not only are no where near there, nor is there a full sidewalk there, we come to find out it's not even the same building within the \"resort\" grounds. As a matter of fact, what we're in is more like an old apartment building with actually residence! Pour teenager had to cross a 4 lane highway just to fish the pond d's on the other side of the highway because the ponds were posted not fishing.\n",
      " To top it all off, the wall separating our 2 units is between the 2 master bedrooms & it is so thin we can clearly hear the phone conversations our son is having on the other side,  so there is no privacy either! \n",

Oh! & it would have been nice to know that the lazy river where the cool little water park is, is closed for the season! We have to walk our kids down to the other building to swim at their pools. Imagine walking 5 Littles through goose poop covered lawns to & from pools all wet & shivering, then having to use those same towels to dry off with after their showers. The fitness center, which is also at the other buildings, is closed for the entire week (not to our knowledge til we got here) for...??? My husband & teenage son had to get a week membership with the local gym! \"Resort\"??? Ha! A motel would have been better!\n",

      "I had a very unpleasant experience with them.  The car company from which I was actually renting told me their insurance was a scam, and I could cancel it and buy theirs.  But you must cancel by one minute before the time you are scheduled to pick up the car, and if you do, you have to also give up the car reservation (and, I assume, the rate you got earlier).  And they don't make it easy to cancel the insurance -- their phone number is nowhere on the email they send you confirming the reservation -- the number you see is for the actual rental company, and that company knows and understands nothing about the online insurance.  I suggest dealing directly with the local company.  I ended up double-insured and grumpy, and I will never go through them again.\n",

I decided to do a first time try with sunglasses as I have astigmatism and wear progressive lens and I know that there are more dynamics involved with that. I ordered my sunglasses (WileyX) and not only did Frames Direct have the best cost on the frames, they were amazing on the cost of the lens. I went with the best Transition lenses with all the coatings and they beat all my local shops by at least 200.00. I received the glasses in a timeframe stated by Frames Direct and tFrames Direct highly athey are awesome. I went to my local shop to have the frames fitted properly and they verified that the prescription was filled properly.

      "After 5 years, my secretary/receptionist decided to give me 1 week notice she was leaving. I panicked and put an posted an ad for a receptionist. After reviewing over 300 resumes in a 24 hour period and interviewing 6 people, I decided to check out a \"virtual receptionist\". I checked around and then called Servcorp at their Irvine office. I spoke to both Bow and Erika. I decided to go with them for a trial period and now, after just a little over 30 days, I cannot be happier. Both are very professional and Bow answers my calls very professionally. She screens my calls for me and if I do not want the call at that time or I am out, the call goes to my voice mail, which in turn sends me an email with a voice message attached so I can listen to the message. After their normal hours (M-F 8:30-5:30), the calls go straight to my voicemail, which Bow very professionally recorded. And the best thing of all, I am saving over $20,000 a year on not having to pay an employee. I actually spoke to my prior receptionist a few days ago and she is not happy where she is working now and looking for a new job again. I think she wanted her job back, which I would have given her had I not found Servcorp. So happy with their services!\n",

I have a mail thread with rentalcars customer support with official apologies and confirmation of internal error caused this incident. Plus I have the same mail confirmation from customer support that E class will be booked for me from another vendor. As a result today I received a notice that no one is responsible and nothing will be changed.

      "I wanted to buy a particular model(RX5228) of Ray-Ban eyeglasses, which I couldn't find anywhere in my hometown so I thought of ordering it on Lenskart based on trust and their reputation. But the problem was that I had no idea on how to enter the power details, so I went to the store to order them.The representative at the store assured me that the glasses were under \"14 days no questions asked return promise\"(WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SCAM) and I'd be given a refund as I had not seen the glasses physically and that I had no idea that it would fit my face. Then the glasses were delivered and found that the print in the temples were of inferior quality and would fade away in time and would like the same model in pure black colour. And now I call the store, and they tell me that they accept returns(how the hell am I supposed to know if the glasses look good on me without trying it?) only for their in-house brands(Vincent chase and John Jacobs). I've called the customer care and they're just stalling for time so that the 14 day period ends and they can just shrug it off! Worst experience and waste of Rs 6700/-. Would never buy from Lenskart again and recommend you not to throw your hard earned money down the drain. I've still got the ticket details if you doubt me.\n",

      "I ordered a phone case from them back in 2014 (that is still in excellent shape today) but I bought a new iphone and needed a new case so decided to order from them again. The new custom case I received was absolutely horrible, totally green in color so I requested to return it for a credit to get another case and they just issued me a credit within  hours of my request and I didn’t even need to return that ugly green case. I ordered another custom case that  arrived today and the  print quality is just as awesome as the one I ordered back in 2014. Very happy I didn’t just give up on them, they really do amazing custom print phone cases (my green colored one must have been a miss quality control but they rectified it without any problems) Thank you Zazzle, you have a customer for life!\n",

It was a little work making sure I was choosing the correct pieces for my application.  Maybe a system where I can enter my parameters and it gives me all of my choices paired with the right screws, plates, etc. so I can choose them easier.  Having said that, the information that WAS given was very helpful in figuring it all out.  More important was the fact that someone called me within just a couple hours of placing my order to go over an issue with me.  I don't expect they call everyone, but I had a large order and there was a slight issue that they resolved with me.  I was very impressed.  I received everything when it was expected and it was packaged well with no damage etc.  And I felt the prices were very good.

      "As the owner of a graphic design company, serving mostly small- to medium-size businesses, I am always aghast to learn how much my customers have been paying for (mostly sub-par) web hosting. At one point, a few years back, I scoured the web, looking for a web hosting provider to whom I could refer my customers with confidence. GreenGeeks is exactly what I hoped for: a (very) reasonably-priced, trustworthy, web hosting service with stellar tech support and, most importantly, NO SURPRISES! My customers can sign up for services without wading through a bunch of pop-up windows offering layers upon layers of costly \"security\" add-ons that they don't need. Initiating web hosting with GreenGeeks is straight-forward and affordable, and the site migration process is always a snap. The few times that I needed to contact Tech Support to ask a question, they answered immediately, responded professionally, and offered great suggestions and advice. GreenGeeks makes me look great to my customers! I've literally \"seen it all\" with the shady deals that other web hosting companies trick people into. GreenGeeks is the web hosting company I always recommend.\n",

      "-Sales rep couldn't answer some basic questions about ownership\n",
      "-He seemed to think that there are spas.......in fact it would appear as though there are less than 10 stores and that they are not corporately owned....no spas in sight \n",

In my case, I cycle right now (summer), about 50 miles per week and I am fair complected so he was actually seeing the sun under my cycling glasses......\n",
      "------I have an autoimmune disorder, which has caused a very mild hyper pigmentation on my upper neck. It cannot be cured, however in some cases it can be lightened. I was assured before he noticed that, that the product was not a lightener, like other inferior products. When he saw my neck he insisted it was treatable (huh?! where did you get your dermatology degree exactly?), and when I told him what it was he still tried to convince me that there was a benefit. \n",
      "\n",

Unfortunately it did not arrive on time and even more unfortunate was the greater damage on it.  This one had a large gash on the box which pierced through the print!  Needless to say, I was upset.  iCanvas again responded quickly and accommodated my request for a full refund.  So great service, but needs to either improve the quality of their packaging or change their shipping partner.  This frustrating experience was enough to keep me from ordering again. Sorry.\n",

The issue was the phone was bought by a 3rd party and when unlocking, it would return an unable to unlock due to unpaid history. This was annoying since I really needed the phone to work and ended up using the service. At first, they charged $17 USA to run a semi unlock. Within a week, they emailed back saying I needed a premium unlock which costed an additional $63 USA. The total was about $80 to unlock but after a total amount of 20 whole days from start date to end with unlock email, it was successful. Took a while considering the time frame was said to be 3-15 days but better late then never. Thank you for the good service!\n",

The online videos, sample tests and the books on ITIL were a real help in understanding the standards.Sincere advise from my end is that, Course content is good but does not prepare you for sample exams provided which are a lot harder than the quizz questions in the course. You need to study additional material to prepare.I liked the customer support and the approach. Thanks again guys. Keep up the good work.\n",

The support, the tracking with NuMi, the tickers, the advice, especially the advice for getting through \"wobbles\" are all good. I'm disappointed with the food, however. Not that's it's not good for what it is (processed and microwave packages) -- but that it's so heavy on cakes and muffins and sweet bars. I cannot abide sweets for breakfast, and that's all there is... Even sweetened cereal and oatmeal. There is no way to get a package (on \"my way core\") that excludes breakfast and desserts without going ala carte, and I'm sure that's far more expensive.  I am skipping a bunch of this and maybe if I meet my goal they will come in handy for snacks down the road. At least they have a long shelf life. The bottom line is, will I lose the weight, and with the portion control for lunch and dinner I think I can.\n",

Tried on line.  didn't work.  called in and someone walked me through it.  I wanted a customized verse.  I requested writing on front of card in silver and inside verse in red.  When the front turned to red also, I was assured that notes were made and the correction would be made.  When I received the proof to approve, the verse was so small one couldn't read it to tell if it was correct or not...it looked like a postage stamp on a field of white..  Called told it would be corrected...it wasn't when I received another request to approve.  2-3 weeks later FINALLY got some one (I think it was Brandy) who finally got it right, increased the font size on the verse and who took the time to explain that in order to have the name on the outside of the card in a different color from the verse it was an additional $100 plus dollars...Fine, just don't know why that wasn't told to me by the first 3-4 people I spoke with and why the writing in the verse was ever made so small.  The cards look great now\n",

During this terrible time, it was comforting to know that we could make important care decisions without concerns about cost. Trupanion reimbursed us quickly for 90% of everything less the one time deductible and the small administrative fees. During a time of stress and ultimately grief, Trupanion came through. \n",

The inspector came on June 12th and told me there were multiple issues with the install, and I would be contacted to get the issues corrected, he told me it may require a complete reinstall.

It has handled the Midwest winters over the past couple of years and continues to perform as promised.

I called and was told it was on back order and I have not received anything yet. It’s been weeks. No one followerd up with me. On top of that they left a cabinet on the porch. Once my contractor started putting up cabinets he noticed three different area of cabinets space is either to small to fit all cabinets  or to big for the cabinets to fit from the beginning to end of the wall.  The space was measured by the company twice. She came out to check measurements. At this time I have no answers. No one has returned my calls and I still don’t have my missing parts. Don’t get any cabinets  from here if have had read these reviews before I purchased you cabinets. I would have ran fast! But a friend recommended this place so I went off of her experience.\n",

I called 14 June 17 after they calling every few days to see what happened to my refund and they said we are not going to refund it is a voluntary return and this is past the 30 days allowed for return.

My discover card is not on my dashboard, I have called Cecilia De Leon numerous times and have left at least 3 or 4 messages and no return calls.

      "Thriftbooks is a great resource for any book in or out of print. The notification function is ideal, with email notification the minute your requested  book is located ; I have found many titles this way. That said, the quality is uneven. Each selection has the graded condition listed for your selection prior to purchase. This is very accurate on the Good and below levels, but for the higher ratings I find it a gamble. Books listed as like new which come from independent sellers are generally as advertised.  Books listed as like new that come directly from Thriftbooks warehouse are generally beat up. If you don't care about appearances, them it's no worry. But I have been burned many times purchasing a book that I intended to gift, only to receive it and realize the \"like new\" book was often scratched and bent and in no condition to give as a gift.\n",
      "I ordered the ladies x-large, which I usually order and it was big enough to fit another person in with me. Not such a big deal. However, the white T with the yellow writing, which was the one I ordered, faded so badly when I washed it that it looks like a 10 year old shirt that I've washed hundreds of times. I wanted to wash it before I wore it. Cold water wash, hung to dry. Now I'll only wear it to sleep in.\n",
      "I ordered a set - ballpoint, rollerball and fountain pen two weeks ago and paid for a more expedited shipping timeframe.  After several days I was advised that only the ballpoint would ship as the rest was out of stock - the remainder would be shipped upon receipt when they received their next shipment in seven days.  I called after 8 days and they said their order was delayed another week.  Surprised they didn't email me as soon as they learned they didn't receive their shipment.  Really surprised that no one offered to refund what I'd paid for expedited shipping.  At this point all I can do is wait as they already have my money\n",

They were very cooperative and the facilitators were down-to-earth and personable. We did the Teddy Rescue Bear (Build a Teddy Bear) activity and it was lots of fun. I would definitely do it again or try one of the other activities. The best parts are the games, puzzles, and trivia you have to complete to gain experience for the specific activity\n",

      "This is my first purchase of a global phone and SIM, and Telestial made the experience very quick and easy.  Telestial was highly-recommended by several reviewers on multiple web sites.  The Telestial website provided thorough information on their offerings including phones, SIM card options, rates and helpful user guides.  I purchased an ekit Economy Pack for my son who is traveling to the Middle East.  The package includes an ekit 4C Dual Sim phone and Passport SIM Card.  The calling rates are much cheaper than our Sprint service, and the phone is a nice, basic text and talk phone which is exactly what he needed.  He has used the phone several times already from Jordan with great call quality and reliable signal.  So far the experience has been great, and I would highly recommend Telestial for global travel communications.\n",

      "I recently purchased a 'desktop replacement' laptop through XoticPC and I have to say they are far and above the best of the best. I wont name any other names, but I had gone through 5 other companies to try and purchase a similar laptop. Trying to find a group of people who could give me a straightforward and honest idea of what I was going to end up spending, the timeframe of when I would receive my laptop, etc. All 5 gave me the runaround, and then XoticPC came through with flying colors. I honestly wish I could give them 6/5 stars because they even dealt with my terrible attitude I had left over from the other 5 companies being so false and impossible to deal with. Even with that, they kept their cool, reassured me, and dealt with me kindly and professionally through the whole process. I will not buy another custom built system from another company. Hands down. Bravo to the last internet company to provide old fashioned, timely, and honest customer service.\n",

I am maintaining at the second weeks gain and just feel my body wants to just hold on to the fat I have carried for so long.  Today I am trying to not do anything wrong, so we will see.  I'm not fond of all the food as I am not a \"sweet tooth\" type of person and everything seems to be coated with sugar. I am eating my own cheerios in the morning as the NS one's are too sweet.  I hope this is ok.  I also seem to be more hungry than I was when I wasn't on the NS diet.  I am hungry every minute.   I don't like shakes and I don't like many bars and I have a ton of them left.

      "I ordered e-cards as I was in a time crunch and the site said orders would be available within 24 hours.  However, the site did not say that orders would be sent ONCE VERIFIED BY PHONE and it took 2 days for me to actually talk to someone before the vouchers were sent.  Every time I called the number noted in the email, I rec'd a recording saying all representatives were busy and someone would call me back.  We played phone tag (as I was at work during the day and am not allowed personal calls) for 48 hours which delayed my delivery.   The gift cards were for a basket for Nurse's Week and we almost did not make the deadline---which we easily would have made if the vouchers had been sent as promised.  I still do not understand the \"verification\" process; they wanted my name, address and charge card---information that I had already provided.  I appreciated the discount on the cards, but it was not as easy getting the cards as advertised.\n",

      "This company deserves 0 rating. Visiting the Zara store with my daughter, she chose a puffer jacket which was priced as £49.99, however it was Black Friday the next day and we decided to wait to see if this jacket would be in the sale, and yes it was to our delight. We purchased the jacket at 20%  off for £39.99 and my daughter was very pleased with her new jacket. Until the following day  looking on the website the same jacket was advertised for £25.99 which is half the original price, there was no indication of this being listed in their special price range of any reference to the original price. This is fraudulent pricing practice. We where not offered the difference for the price which in on their pricing policy terms and conditions. I contacted customer service today and they were both very unhelpful, each informing me that Zara have a right to change their prices from the original price without having to advertise this.  One did not know the head office address for me to complain and told me to google this. I hope me writing this review will help other people understand this pricing policy should not be allowed. I WILL not be spending any more money with Zara as much as i do like the products, it is the principle that there is a reason for Trading Standards .\n",

I read some other reviews about expiry dates so I checked my items & there doesn't appear to be any on the things I ordered.  I found the prices amazing & I was not upset about paying $18 in shipping when it took me 10 minutes to unpack everything because they were so heavily wrapped with plastic bubble wrap for protection. I also thought that the hand written 'thank you' card with a coupon code inside for my next order was a fantastic touch,  It also has the persons name who packed the package & the other persons name who double checked the order.  I am in Canada so not sure if this location has different business practices but I am thrilled with the company.\n",

If something goes wrong with an order, they will make it right, but it takes at least three days to get to talk to someone.  One Christmas gift never received, they will replace it, but not till mid January.  They said it was damaged and could not be delivered, but never notified us.

After over two weeks of silence from the company (no shipping receipt, no UPS tracking number, etc) I had to personally call them to ask what was up. Turns out they hadn't even shipped it because of \"bad weather\". Later I get an email saying according to USPS my package has been lost. I called again and asked for an explanation, and they said \"according to my tracking number, the package is untraceable). I ask for the tracking number to check myself, and the guy gets audibly flustered and starts snapping back at me, changing his story to \"USPS never shipped your package so there is no tracking number\". Everything about this company is super super sketchy, from the Indian guy who always seems to answer my phone calls to the unprofessional emails they send, to the generic positive reviews they seem to get on every site. Just don't order from them, please. Trust me.\r\n",

      "The switch to the new app was rough. I wasn't able to log in for a month and a half and had to call to sign up for classes. The staff on site didn't know how to fix it and wouldn't take the obvious course of action to remedy the situation quickly—delete me from the system and re-enter all info from scratch. They were very helpful and seemed to be following orders, so it seemed to be a course of action from management. Eventually, we wiped the record and I was able to use the app properly. At the same time, my wife was still using the old app and hesitant to switch because of my problems. She eventually had to because she was going to lose her points in the old app. Although it makes sense to use this as a method to herd people into using the new app, it is strange that points could not be moved from one app to another.\n",

To add, there were scuffs and marks on the transparent plastic part of the mug, but we can't return it because the cost of shipping would be more than the mug itself.  No win win situation.\n",

I would be hesitant to use his service ever again as a taxi ride is even less expensive!\n",
      "With  persistence and patience with myself , Stephanie, my customer service representative found my frames.One of my four dogs  at Christmas ate my current frames.I called my optical company, and they said they would search for these particular frames.DEAD ENDS, with suppliers saying they were discontinued. I decided to search, myself... too many (1,038) websites that had these particular  frames,BUT discontinued.My daughter, who is an opthamologist, said she would help me search.After 3+ hours I came across RLE...my daughter,searched  only five minutes, came to me, and she tells me she found a website AND it was the same one I was on-TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE,and they had the particular frames. I ordered them.I  finally after calling Replcement Lens Express-RLE (couldnt get through via phone) I wrote an e-mail to RLE.Stephanie replied,mentioning that CT had been receiving  horrific weather,and  it had affected business-I can relate-living In ND,It didnt  enter my mind, that this might be the reason. I thought I got scammed again-my Visa bank card was hacked and used at over seven stores after Christmas. Stephanie kapt in touch with me via e-mail, constantly...like I was an important customer. Finally, the frames arrived. My optical company couldnt believe it, and Im sure theyll remember your store name, because I raved about the customer service- Stephanie-and how she me feel at ease because they werent shipped RIGHT AWAY...she is the best!!!  If it hadnt been for the  severity of the weather my mind wouldnt have been thinking the worst... have been bed-ridden most of the time since November, so my mind thought of a few reasons for the delay.  It taught me a lesson-to be more patient, and if it hadnt been for Stephanie with CONSTANT status updates......and that all this is just DETAILS in the major course of our lifetimes.Thank you for EVERYTHING and thank Stephanie for her kind replies and updates.Sincerely, Judy A. Brown\n",

My only reservation was that they recommended regular shipping, knowing that I absolutely had to have the banner on a particular day, and if it had arrived late it would have been a disaster for me. But, adding on the cost of 2-day shipping still made it affordable!\n",

They cancelled it 2 days before we turned up at the hotel . 2 days in which they failed to contact me via the verified email address that they had for me or the 2 phone numbers on file. I was stuck in Milan with 2 small children in a fully booked hotel, (they had rebooked our room to another customer). An unhelpful customer service provider at Agoda just made lots of excuses, none valid. We managed to find another family room, difficult in Milan, for twice the price with the help of the original hotel staff. They were as cross with Agoda as I was. Never trust Agoda, book direct with the hotel or use other booking sites. We have never had trouble with Booking.com or TripAdvisor.\n",

The guides provided in the different cities will vary in personality and the accommodation will vary is style, to which you may have a personal preference, but that is to be expected.  Considering the driving conditions in India, we thought our driver was legendary! We would definitely consider using Enchanting Travels again in other countries where we do not feel comfortable organising our own land transport (e.g. hire care or public transport) or think we may have issues with breaching the cultural or language divide.\n",

      "American Frame has a wide selection of frames in wood and metal, and some unusual colors in metal. I appreciated being able to get some sample pieces so that I could be sure which color worked best with my artwork and walls. I think it's great that you can get a kit -- frame, acrylic, and backing board -- for any size you order; that simplifies things and it's much easier than having to buy each piece separately. And they even sent a print catalog with my order! The frames went together quickly, and look great. \r\n",

My ISP in another town provides this flexibility with appropriate limits.\n",

      "Whenever I need to buy something I always head to the Amazon marketplace first because they have a huge selection of items to pick from and they are usually cheaper than what you would pay at the store. Other than being affordable you can see which items are actually high quality because of the reviews that other users leave for them, which I always pay attention to.

I ordered a Mercedes A type with 4 doors and a hatchback, and was offered a Renault Megane with two doors, no luggage space, and a convertible hardtop! Useless!

The only thing I didn't like was that the description of one book stated it was a hardcover. It turned out to be a soft cover galley :( at $9.40, not a good price for a used paperback that hadn't even been proofed yet. I would continue to order from this website, however, because shipping is fast and I can find what I want. I expect this was just a glitch.\n",

He proceeded to chastise me and tell me it was \"CLEARLY written in all emails and appointment reminders\" I looked at all my emails and appt reminders, it was NOWHERE to be found. I pointed that out to him, he said \"oh, well, I will be sure to let my general manager know\" and then I found a $5 I had and said, at least I can leave this until I can come back with cash.

And it was a bonus that the mattress arrived smelling slightly like a sheep.  :)  I loved that!\n",

Overall, from payment to receiving the card, everything was super smooth and quick. In total, the card took about 15 minutes after payment to arrive. I had tried Cardpool right before I tried this site, and not only did they take 24 hours to \"process\" everything, they sent me an email saying their risk assesment team wouldn't process my payment, so that was a huge waste of time.

All his insight plus predictions never happened and these are short term. When I messaged him regarding the matter he said it was my fault!\n",

She charges $18.61 per minute and in her profile she describes her visions as one with \"utmost clarity\" uh ok then how come when I asked you about a potential life partner you said the vision is not set; its cloudy so once I decide to take that path then Ill need to come back so she can see clearly. Ok shes only after my money and her predictions did not come to pass.\n",

She laughed when I told her Im a male and then tried to make up some lie. Other than that to be fair she was quite accurate I just dont like being rushed off!\n",

      "You are the client and she is the advisor and that comes across so clear in her readings. Let me tell you, whenever a reader reads for you, they sense your energy. Most times they will base the reading off your energy. So if youre fearful during a reading in which you ask about your relationship, they sense your fear and will most likely say \"he's not for you\" and this is what I dont like. Youre not a child, you can make your own decisions. This is what sets Alexandra apart from the rest. What she sees transcends beyond that and tella you what is, not what she believes it should be. She is such a smart woman you have GOT  to try her! She will blow you away!!!\n",

HostGator has had zero communication with us and when I call they direct me to their forum. Where is the disaster recovery plan?!? If you have a backup put it on a new server/restore an image of the downed server. I have a hard time believing that this is only affecting a \"few\" customers. Their hold time has been 30 min plus and their chat over an hour and they are definitely NOT in communication with customers. Over the last few days we have experienced the WORST customer experience we have ever had and we will never do business with HostGator again, not because of the problem but because of the way it is being handled.\n",
